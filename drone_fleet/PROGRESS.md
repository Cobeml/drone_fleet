- [x] Set up path planners and controllers
- [x] Configured behavior trees

## âœ… Completed Phase 3: Core Nodes

### Fleet Manager (C++)
- [x] Monitors drone states (position, battery, status)
- [x] Publishes fleet status as JSON
- [x] Subscribes to individual drone topics
- [x] Handles multiple drones dynamically

### Mission Planner (Python)
- [x] Waypoint navigation system
- [x] Predefined NYC locations
- [x] Three demo missions (tour, delivery, patrol)
- [x] Mission status publishing

## âœ… Completed Phase 4: Integration

### Launch System

## Current Status

The backend foundation is **ready for testing**. You can:

1. Build and run the Docker container
2. Launch Gazebo with the drone
3. Test basic navigation
4. Monitor fleet status
5. Send mission commands

### To Run:
```bash
cd /workspace/drone_fleet
./setup.sh
docker-compose run --rm ros2-drone-fleet
# Inside container:
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch drone_fleet_core drone_fleet_launch.py
```

### Test Commands:
```bash
# Send a mission
ros2 topic pub -1 /mission/request std_msgs/String '{data: "{\"drone\": \"drone1\", \"mission\": \"tour_midtown\"}"}'

# Monitor status
ros2 topic echo /fleet/status
```

## Time Estimate

- **Completed**: ~40% of backend
- **NYC Data Integration**: 2-3 days
- **Advanced Features**: 3-4 days
- **Testing & Polish**: 2-3 days

**Total to hackathon-ready**: 1-1.5 weeks of focused development
